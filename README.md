# Strategy

1. Don't spend money if not needed. do it by offering 0 to USC if no campaign in the near future
2. Offer alot of money for campaigns that won't give enough money when taken
3. Offer minimum for campaigns and adjust it by the difference from the offer after you with respect to the length of the campaign
4. offer almost minimum to impressions and increase the offer if getting short in time
5. adjust the USC bid - TODO
